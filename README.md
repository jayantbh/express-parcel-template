# Express + Parcel Template

**Do you want to:**
1. ðŸ“ƒ Serve mostly static pages.
2. ðŸ’… Use SASS or most other kinds of file types
3. ðŸ’» Be able to leverage SSR
4. ðŸ¦¥ Configure basically nothing

Then this repo is for you ðŸ‘ˆ 
This can do everything that parcel can, because the build is powered by parcel, but you also get the benefits of SSR using Handlebars templating ðŸ‘Œ 
Plus, it's driven by an express server, so your pages can be hydrated by the node backend ðŸ’ª

**Just clone this repo and make it yours!**

Steps to get started:

1. git clone git@github.com:jayantbh/express-parcel-template.git my-project
2. cd my-project
3. rm -rf .git
4. git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"

And you're ready to go!

ðŸ‘‰ While this works pretty well for most basic use-cases where you just want to serve SSR powered mostly static pages, if you want more dynamic pages or state management or more application-like features, consider using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) instead.
